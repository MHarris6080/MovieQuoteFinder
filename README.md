## Project Description
MovieQuoteFinder is an innovative cross platform app that helps users identify any movie or TV show simply by typing or speaking a famous quote or phrase. Powered by natural language processing (NLP) and a vast database of scripts, captions, and metadata, this app delivers quick and accurate results, including title, year, and where to watch it.

## Problem Addressing
Users often remember iconic lines from shows or movies but cannot recall their titles. Traditional search engines require precise wording and lack contextual awareness. MovieQuoteFinder solves this by enabling flexible, fuzzy search with NLP, empowering fans, content creators, and streaming service users to quickly find and enjoy content.

## Platform
- iOS, Android, and Web (PWA)
- Built with Flutter or React Native for cross-platform deployment.

## Frontend/Backend Support
- **Frontend**: Flutter/React Native for seamless UI/UX and voice search.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB for flexible storage, Elasticsearch for fast quote searches, and API integrations (IMDb/OMDb).

## Functionality
- Search by exact or paraphrased quotes
- Voice-to-text input
- Scene preview with metadata and streaming links
- Favorites and search history
- Social media sharing
- Admin dashboard for content updates

## Design (Wireframes)
1. **Splash Screen**: Logo and tagline animation.
2. **Home/Search Page**: Search bar with mic icon.
3. **Results Page**: Poster thumbnails, title, year, quote context.
4. **Details Page**: Scene info, trivia, streaming links.
5. **Favorites Page**: Saved searches and movies.

## GitHub Setup
